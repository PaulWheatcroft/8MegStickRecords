                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><strong>8 Meg Stick Records</strong> was born out of necessity, a vessel to release the genius of <strong>Don Pablo</strong>, a once-thriving duo from Wells, Somerset. Their songs were nothing short of fabulous, and with 50% of the band founding the label, it was only fitting that <strong>8 Meg Stick</strong>—a track by Don Pablo—became the label's namesake. One day, that track will see the light of day, but since the label's inception, new musical projects have sprouted and flourished, expanding the label's horizons.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">We don't believe in labels or restrictions. Quality is our creed, not the genre it fits into. Take <strong>Pengamax</strong>, for instance. Their first release is a stone-cold blues banger, while their second is an E.P. of ambient soundscapes that evoke cinematic vistas.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Full disclosure: 50% of Don Pablo is a piece of every act on our roster, including 100% of <strong>PAULI</strong>. We're eager to bring more artists into the fold. This isn't about getting rich; it's about the music. We handle recording, mixing, mastering, and getting your tracks into all the major digital stores.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Got a creative idea? Want to collaborate? We'd love to hear from you.</p>

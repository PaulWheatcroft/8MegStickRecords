                <div class="p-6">
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Don Pablo</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Born out of the chaotic, post-millennium haze, Don Pablo was a force
                        of nature. Between 2002 and 2006, they unleashed a barrage of wildly imaginative tracks that
                        left an indelible mark on the music scene.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Fast forward to today, and the duo has been buried under the mundane
                        grind of everyday life. But fear not, because <strong>8 Meg Stick Records</strong> is on a
                        mission to dig up Don Pablo's buried treasure and share it with anyone who dares to listen. Fun
                        fact: <strong>8 Meg Stick</strong> is actually the title of a Don Pablo song.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Their sound? It's a paradox. As organic as it is synthetic, as warm as
                        it is cold. Their debut release, <strong>Campfire</strong>, features trembling Hammond organs,
                        while their second single, <strong>Pretty Picture</strong>, growls with synths and paints a
                        vivid, Bonnie & Clyde-esque narrative. But it's their E.P., <strong>Much Better in Our
                            Youth</strong>, that truly reveals Don Pablo's soul, with melancholic tales of lost loves,
                        missed chances, and the ever-changing weather.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">PAULI</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Looking for the glue that holds <strong>8 Meg Stick</strong> together?
                        Enter <strong>PAULI</strong>. One-fifth of <strong>We Used To See The Sky</strong>, the "Pablo"
                        in Don Pablo, and the go-to guy for outsourced production. PAULI is 8 Meg Stick Records, no
                        doubt about it.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">2020 was the year PAULI found his voice. His mental state was laid
                        bare for all to see, and 2021 promises more glimpses into his psyche. It was also the year he
                        discovered the magic of open tuning and simple guitar chords, unlocking a whole new sonic
                        palette.</p>
                    <p class=“text-gray-700 mb-4”>On January 22nd, 2021, with their debut release <strong>4
                            Walls</strong>, we remember those early lockdown days when the weather was warm, Zoom was a
                        computer virus, and life felt like that weird limbo between Christmas and New Year, where you
                        just eat and drink because you’re too stuffed and tipsy to do anything else. Then came
                        <strong>Love Life</strong>, a raw, unfiltered look at how everyone online hides behind untrue
                        personas, like characters in a twisted digital masquerade. It was a mirror held up to the face
                        of social media, reflecting the masks we wear and the truths we bury. And just when you thought
                        you had PAULI figured out, they dropped <strong>Caught</strong>, a haunting exploration of the
                        darkest time in their life. It was a descent into the abyss, but also the catalyst for a
                        powerful transformation, turning pain into a beacon of hope and change. Each track was a chapter
                        in a story that was as gripping as it was real, pulling no punches and leaving no stone
                        unturned.</p>

            <!-- Pengamax Card -->
            <div class="bg-white shadow-lg rounded-lg overflow-hidden mb-6">
                <div class="p-6">
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Pengamax</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Not all things are created equal, and that includes the enigmatic
                        multi-instrumentalist <strong>Pengamax</strong>. With a mountain of unreleased tracks on the 8
                        Meg Stick drive, Pengamax's desire to explore the musical spectrum is in overdrive.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Their first single, <strong>Mitti</strong>, is a bold step into the
                        blues, a modern, pandemic-era tale that hits hard. But Pengamax doesn't rest on their laurels.
                        Their second release dives into cinematic territory, with ethereal and epic soundscapes that
                        transport you to a sunrise over an unknown world on their E.P., <strong>G Formations</strong>.
                        What's next? Your guess is as good as mine.</p>

            <!-- We Used To See The Sky Card -->

                <div class="p-6">
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">We Used To See The Sky</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><strong>We Used To See The Sky</strong>, a Bristol five-piece, owes
                        its existence to Damon Albarn and its name to British Romantic painter Samuel Palmer. Formed
                        from the ashes of a failed Damon Albarn tribute act, keyboard player Paul and singer Mike
                        decided that creating original music was the way forward. Guitarist Steve also made the jump
                        from the tribute act <strong>Allbarn</strong> (get it?), and thus, We Used To See The Sky was
                        born.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Their non-linear musical style fits perfectly with the 8 Meg Stick
                        ethos of "anything goes." Their debut track, <strong>Slippy Guppy</strong> (yes, really),
                        radiates with acoustic warmth, while their second track, <strong>Deep Fake</strong>, is a
                        beat-heavy commentary on modern technology's mistrust.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">And as for Samuel Palmer? Catch We Used To See The Sky live, where
                        keyboard player Paul often gives impromptu lectures on the subject while the band tunes up.</p>

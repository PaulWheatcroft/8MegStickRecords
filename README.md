## Design Choices

The persona that 8 Meg Stick Records wish to primarily target are likely to be viewing the site on a phone. Therefore the site will be a mobile first approach.

The number one feature is links from each release to 6 of the most popular streaming platforms. These are:

- Spotify
- Apple Music
- YouTube Music
- Amazon Music
- Deezer
- Tidal

The look and feel of the site needs to be built around the 8 Meg Stick Records branding. The website needs to feel modern, vivid with vibrant and dynamic touches. The tone should
be professional but not corporate.

Below is the brand colour pallet for 8 Meg Stick Records. Whilst these form the foundation of the colour scheme other strong colours will be required to support vibrant 
accents on the website. Bold use of band photography and imagery is encouraged.

| Description | Hex Colour Value |
| --- | ----------- |
| Dark grey which can be used extensively | #1a1a1a |
| Off white which can be used extensively | #f9f9f9 |
| Light yellow to be used as a primary colour | #ffdd55 |
| Darker yellow to be used as a secondary supportive colour | #d4aa00 |
| Sky blue to be used as a main highlight colour | #80ffe6 |
| Complimentary supporting  pink highlight colour | #ffaeae |
| Complimentary supporting  green highlight colour | #b7ffa5 |


The main font used in the 8 Meg Stick Records logo is not available as a web font. This is a serif font. No other serif fonts should be used as may detract from the logo. 

The secondary font used in the logo is Noto Sans TC. This is available as a web font and will be used for headings.

Noto Sans will be used as the main content font as this is a complimentary font to Noto Sans TC.  

## Structure

Whilst the focus is on a mobile first design the website needs to provide an optimal experience across all screen types.

To ensure the experience is focussed on the releases this will be a multi-page website consisting of 4 pages.

1. Releases
2. Artists
3. About
4. Get in Touch

There is a horizontal navigation bar at the top of each page facilitating access to other pages on the site. This navigation element will collapse on a mobile device.

The index.html page will contain the releases connect as this is the main focus of the site. All other pages follow a consistent look and feel to the main page including 
the same footer element which contain the record labels social media links.

### The Releases Page

The top of the page consists strong imagery advertising the latest release or next up and coming release from the record label. This section enables the 
viewer to sign up for new music release alerts from the label. This section needed to take up most but not all of the viewing area as to reveal the releases
beneath the hero image. The releases will be in in chronological order of their release date. 
Each release section should display:

- Song title
- Artist name which links to the artist profile that will be situated on the artists page
- Cover art
- Links to streaming services

### The Artists Page

Beneath the navigation bar which is common to all of the pages the Artists page will contain a section on each artist. This progresses down the page in alphabetical order. 
Each artist section contains:

- Artist name
- Biography of the artist
- Links to their tracks on the releases page
- Photos and imagery (if available)
- Videos (if available)
- Social media links (if available)
- Any other links that support the artists profile

### The About Page

Beneath the navigation bar which is common to all of the pages the About page will contain a section on the record label. This section will contain:

- An overview of the record label
- Outline the record label ethos and musical direction
- link to a form to submit a demo

### The Get in Touch Page

Beneath the navigation bar which is common to all of the pages the Get in Touch page will contain 3 forms.

1. A form to register or notifications of new releases
2. A form to submit a demo
3. A general contact form

## Wireframing

<img src="images/devices.png" style="margin: 0;">

Mocking up of the site was done using Figma. I chose to use full images and colour as opposed to sketch/line drawings as the site would have many images and elements and therefore be visually busy so I needed to understand the relationships of these images such as the release cover art.

A Figma wireframe for each page can be found in the links Below.

[Releases - index.html](https://www.figma.com/file/lbEOracgvjZ4jw3uFd6hJd/8-Meg-Stick-Records?node-id=0%3A1)

[Artists](https://www.figma.com/file/lbEOracgvjZ4jw3uFd6hJd/8-Meg-Stick-Records?node-id=31%3A2)

[About](https://www.figma.com/file/lbEOracgvjZ4jw3uFd6hJd/8-Meg-Stick-Records?node-id=49%3A79)

[Get in Touch](https://www.figma.com/file/lbEOracgvjZ4jw3uFd6hJd/8-Meg-Stick-Records?node-id=49%3A207)

## Design Choices

I decided to go with the hero text centrally aligned as it suited the final images more.

SVG files were used for the streaming link icons as not all were available in FontAwesome.

Bootstrap was used throughout the website build as this was a rapid way to build the structure of the site. Using Bootstrap's Flex element in the hero image will ensure that the positioning of the text elements used in the hero image can be easily changed to suite the promotional image of that specific music release.

I put the releases background CSS at the top of the files for easy access when new music is released.

Accessibility was checked at [www.webaccessibility.com](https://www.webaccessibility.com/)

Responsiveness was checked thought using the Google dev tools and [www.responsinator.com](https://www.responsinator.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpaulwheatcroft.github.io%2FMS1-8MegStick%2Findex.html)

A code review was posted in the Code Institute peer-code-review channel. Following feedback I changed the footer logo image to link back to the Releases page.

I used a wide group of friends and family to test the user stories across the following operating systems and browsers.

- Windows (multiple computers)
    - Internet Explorer 11
    - Microsoft Edge
    - Chrome
    - Firefox
    - Opera
- macOS (MacBook Air and iMac)
    - Safari
    - Chrome
- Android (OPPO Reno 2, Nokia 3.2, Huawei P Smart 2019)
    - Native OPPO handset browser
    - Chrome browser
- iOS (iPhone 7, iPhoneX, iPhone SE)
    - Safari

Functional testing was carried out against every element to ensure everything worked and was linked as expected before user tested was started. This was recorded in [functional-testing.xlsx](functional-testing.xlsx). Another tab was added after user testing to regression test functionality following changes through the user testing feedback.

## Bugs and issues

I encountered an issue with syntax when displaying and image. The site would like fine in Gitpod but the images would be missing when viewing the site via Github. This was down to relative paths of the images when referenced withing the CSS file.

I initially started using SVG files directly in the code but some of the strings were so large it caused an error in Gitpod. I switched to referencing the .svg file instead. I also had an issue where the navbar text logo SVG stopped rendering properly when implemented directly.

Both the YouTube embed and the modal gallery code i used returned validation issues when checked through the W3C Nu HTML Checker. These were corrected to comply.

Accessibility testing raised warnings about using placeholder text instead of label text, which was hidden. I initially chose to do this for aesthetic reasons but reflecting on warnings I decided accessibility of the forms was more important. That the websites text is justified also raised a warning but i decided that for the design of the site it was OK to leave it justified as the text did not appear to be impacted and the content of the text is not of significant/critical importance.

## Deployment

The Project has been deployed via Github Pages. To do this:

1.  Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2.  At the top of the Repository locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
3.  Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4.  Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch". The page will automatically refresh.
5.  Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.

## Acknowledgements

The project was started using the The Code Institute's [Gitpod Full Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).

The template is integrated with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) 4.5.3 which was used throught the project for the structure and layout of the website.

The Code Institute [SampleREADME](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/SampleREADME) was referenced regularly to shape this README correctly.

The [Mark Down Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) was also referenced when creating this README.

README icons were created by using Segoe UI Symbol font and Inkscape.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) used for displaying Noto Sans, Noto Sans TC and Monoton fonts.

The streaming icons were downloaded from [simpleicons.org](https://simpleicons.org/)

I was able to get the YouTube videos on the Artists page to scale nicely with the Bootstrap grid system thanks to [Chris Coyier's](https://css-tricks.com/author/chriscoyier/) tutorial on [Fluid Vidio Layout](https://css-tricks.com/fluid-width-video/) .

A simple [modal image solution](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-create-a-modal-image-gallery-with-css-and-javascript) from [Amit Diwan](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/answers/amitdiwan) was used on the Artists page. 

Thanks to [Mohammad Usman's](https://stackoverflow.com/users/5933656/mohammad-usman) answer to this [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38850419/how-to-create-multi-color-border-with-css) about mulitple colours on a border.

I used this page on Stackoverflow to implement a [browser colour change on mobile](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26960703/how-to-change-the-color-of-header-bar-and-address-bar-in-newest-chrome-version-o).

The footer Social media links were amended from those used in the Code Institue HTML/CSS Project - Love Running.

All Images were created by the developer.

Thanks to my Code Institue mentor for useful direction and insights.

## Further Development Ideas

- For ease of administration it would be beneficial to create a form that could populate the new releases meaning someone non-technical could add these to the page.
- It would be nice if the Notify Me button in the hero image on the Releases page opened the form in a modal box overlaying the Releases page.
- The JavaScript gallery used is adequate but not as elegant as it could be. For instance the thumbnails are squashed images.
- It may be necessary to introduce pagination for the releases in future. Especially on a mobile phone view.
